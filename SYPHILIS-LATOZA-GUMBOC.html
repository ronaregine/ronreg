<h1 style="color:red;">Chancroid (Syphilis)</h1>
<h2 style="color:black;">Syphilis is an acute and chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is
acquired through sexual contact or may be congenital in origin. The disease starts as a sore that is often
painless and typically appears on the genitals, rectum or mouth. <p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Signs and Symptoms of Syphilis
<h3>The course of untreated syphilis can be divided into three stages: <p>
• Primary <p>
• Secondary <p>
• Latent <p>
• Tertiary <p>
These stages reflect the time from infection and the clinical manifestations observed in that period and are
the basis for treatment decisions.<p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Primary Syphilis <p>
<h3>The first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre. The sore is often painless. It appears at the
spot where the bacteria entered your body. Most people with syphilis develop only one chancre. Some
people get more than one. <p>
• Occurs 2 to 3 weeks after initial inoculation with the organism. <p>
• Painless lesions at the site of infection, called chancres, usually resolve spontaneously within 3 to
12 weeks, with or without treatment (Norris, 2019). <p>
• Tiredness, also called fatigue <p>
• Weight loss, swollen lymph nodes <p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Secondary Syphilis <p>
<h3>You may get a rash while the first chancre heals or a few weeks after it heals.
A rash caused by syphilis:  <p>
• Often is not itchy <p>
• May look rough, red or reddish-brown <p>
• Might be so faint that it's hard to see. <p>
• Occurs by hematogenous spread leading to generalized infection. The rash of secondary syphilis
occurs from 1 week to 6 months after the chancre <p>
• Transmission can occur through contact with these lesions. <p>
• Generalized signs of infection may include lymphadenopathy, arthritis, meningitis, hair loss, fever,
malaise, and weight loss. <p>
• Symptoms of secondary syphilis may go away on their own. But without treatment, they could
come and go for months or years. <p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Latent Syphilis <p>
<h3>When the person who is infected has no signs or symptoms of syphilis. Latency can be interrupted by a
recurrence of secondary syphilis symptoms If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the
secondary stage to the latent stage. This also is called the hidden stage because you have no symptoms.
The latent stage can last for years. Your symptoms may never come back, but without treatment, the disease
might lead to major health problems, also called complications.
 <p>


<h2 style="color:blue;">Tertiary Syphilis <p>
<h3>After the latent stage, up to 30% to 40% of people with syphilis who don't get treatment have complications
known as tertiary syphilis. Another name for it is late syphilis.
The disease may damage the: 
 <p>
• Brain, nerves, eyes. heart, blood vessels, liver. bones and joints. <p>
• The final stage in the natural history of the disease. It is estimated that between 20% and 40% of
those infected do not exhibit signs and symptoms in this final stage. <p>
• Tertiary syphilis may present as a slowly progressive inflammatory disease with the potential to
affect multiple organs. <p>
• The most common manifestations at this level are aortitis and neurosyphilis, as evidenced by
dementia, psychosis, paresis, stroke, or meningitis (Norris, 2019). <p>

<h1 style="color:red;">Medical Management</h1> <p>
<h3>Treatment of all stages of syphilis is administration of antibiotic medications. 
 <p>
• Penicillin G benzathine- is the medication of choice for early syphilis or early latent syphilis of
less than 1 year’s duration. It is given by intramuscular injection at a single session. Patients with
late latent or latent syphilis of unknown duration should receive three injections at 1-week
intervals. <p>
• Doxycycline- The patient treated with penicillin is monitored for 30 minutes after the injection to
observe for a possible allergic reaction.

<h1 style="color:red;">Diagnostic/ Laboratory</h1> <p>
<h3>Blood Tests- Non-Treponemal Tests: These include the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory
(VDRL) and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) tests. They detect antibodies that the body produces in
response to the infection. These tests are usually used for screening purposes. <p>
• Treponemal Tests- Examples include the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA), fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS), and enzyme immunoassays (EIAs).
These tests detect antibodies specifically against Treponema pallidum and are used to confirm a
syphilis infection. <p>
• Dark-field Microscopy- a sample of fluid from a syphilitic sore (chancre) is examined under a
microscope using dark-field microscopy. Treponema pallidum bacteria can be seen directly with
this method. <p>
• PCR Test- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can detect the genetic material of Treponema
pallidum in samples from lesions or body fluids. <p>
• Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis- If neurosyphilis is suspected, a lumbar puncture may be performed
to analyze cerebrospinal fluid for signs of infection. <p>
